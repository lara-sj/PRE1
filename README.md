# Precourse Section 1

These are the tasks you should aim to complete in your first 1-2 weeks doing the Precourse. You can switch between them - don't feel you have to complete everything in order, especially if you're having issues with one particular problem.

As well as your technical ability, we also want you to show you can handle the workload and pace of a coding bootcamp. This means providing regular updates of your progress, and letting us know if you get stuck. We encourage you to attend our regular drop-in sessions and make use of the 'Precouse' Slack channel (if you haven't received an invite let us know).

### Basic Skills

You've probably already shown in your tech test that you know how to handle these situation, but make sure you are absolutely confident with them as they will underpin everything you do in JavaScript in this Precourse and beyond.

* Store a value as a variable
* Execute code conditionally ('if' something is true)
* Access an item in an array if you know its index
* Access a value of an object if you know its key
* Iterate through an array or string
* Create a function with parameters that returns a value
* Execute a function with parameters
* Log values to the console

### Problem Solving

Problem solving is the number one skill that employers in the tech sector value - good problem solvers are able to work in any language, technology or situation.

Please watch [these 5 videos by Michael Starbird](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEo7ej2RhHszJy_77UXC8GJpb8LtW-dJT). The first two in particular really chime with the Northcoders philosophy. Try to apply what you have learnt in these videos to the next coding problems you encounter.

If you haven't already done so, please work through some of the [Algorithm Challenges on FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting). All of the problems in this chapter are excellent practice - we recommend trying to solve 5 of them as a minimum.

### Coding Style

It's important our code is easy to read and well laid out. As well as helping other people, it also makes our life easier when we go back and read our code over at a later date.

Read this article and implement these styling guidelines when working through the rest of the Precourse:
https://javascript.info/coding-style

Always be asking yourself 'if I was to take away the question and any comments, can someone still understand what my code is doing?'

### Codewars

There are lots of sites that offer katas (self-contained coding problems) for you to sharpen your problem-solving skills. One of the most important things you can do is get as much practise problem-solving with JavaScript as possible.

Sign up with [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/r/LwRQbA) and email us at [precourse@northcoders.com](mailto:precourse@northcoders.com) to let us know your account name so we can track your progress, if you haven't already. You should be aiming to complete level 8, 7 and 6 katas to put into practise what you are learning in the Precourse.  You should aim to have 200 points before you start the Developer Pathway. Take the opportunity to look at other people's solutions - but remember, the shortest isn't necessarily the best. Clarity should always be your number one concern.

Here are some recommended Codewars katas to get you started.

 - [Max and Min Values](http://www.codewars.com/kata/find-maximum-and-minimum-values-of-a-list)
 - [Miles per gallon to kilometers per liter](http://www.codewars.com/kata/miles-per-gallon-to-kilometers-per-liter)
 - [Find nth Digit](http://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-nth-digit-of-a-number)
 - [Are the numbers in order?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/are-the-numbers-in-order)
 - [Get the Middle Character](http://www.codewars.com/kata/get-the-middle-character)
 - [Removing Elements](http://www.codewars.com/kata/removing-elements)
 - [Initialize my name](http://www.codewars.com/kata/initialize-my-name)
 - [Needle in a Haystack](http://www.codewars.com/kata/a-needle-in-the-haystack)
 - [Powers of Two](http://www.codewars.com/kata/powers-of-2)
 - [Chinese Zodiac](http://www.codewars.com/kata/chinese-zodiac)
 - [Leet Speak](http://www.codewars.com/kata/toleetspeak)
 - [Product of largest pair](http://www.codewars.com/kata/product-of-largest-pair)
 - [Palindrome strings](http://www.codewars.com/kata/palindrome-strings)

Whilst doing this, you should start to use built-in JavaScript methods - functions that have already been implemented for common issues in programming that you can apply to a type of value, like an array or object. If you find yourself writing code likely to be useful in a lot of situations, check if a method exists for this already. The place to go to read about built-in methods is the MDN documentation. Here are a few useful methods to get you started:

- [toUpperCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) / [toLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase)
- [toString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString)
- [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
- [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join)
- [reverse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse)
- [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)
- [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf)
- [toFixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed)

### The Command Line

Please read [this article](http://learntocodewith.me/getting-started/topics/command-line/) that explains why we use the command line.

Follow a tutorial on how to use the command line. There are some differences between macOS and Linux command line (Ubuntu, Mint...) so choose the appropriate one: 
 - [macOS](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/4614926-learn-the-command-line-in-terminal?status=published)
 - [Linux](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners)
 
Follow the whole course up to the end. Code Academy also has [more practice material](https://codeacademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) on the command line too.

Print out or bookmark this [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/) of common commands. The directories and files commands are most useful so try to practice with these and commit them to memory as soon as possible.

From now onwards, try to **always** use your terminal program (iTerm, Hyper, Terminator or git bash) to navigate around your computer, make, move, copy or remove files and folders.

### Git / Github

Version control is a necessity in modern-day programming. Git and Github are big topics and we will explore them during the course in more detail, but they will be part of your daily workflow from day 1, so take some time to begin to learn how they work.

Make sure you have installed git (revisit the Install Guide if necessary) and that we have your Github account details.

For a basic introduction to git and Github, please watch videos 1-7 of [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

Try out git yourself by following the GitHub Learning Lab course at the bottom of this page of the [GitHib Learning Resources](https://try.github.io/).

You will need to use git to download this repository so that you can complete the final challenges!

### Challenges

The challenges attached to this section are designed to test your coding ability and help you build familiarity with the environment you will be using every day on the course. We

we are looking for you to show your understanding of the different types of values there are in JavaScript, and some of their attached methods. We also want to see your ability to solve problems and use what you've learnt about JavaScript logic creatively.

These videos show the workflow required to get and solve the final challenges. There's step-by-step instructions below too - this will put your skills with the command line and git to the test, alongside JavaScript problem solving.

[Forking and cloning the project](https://youtu.be/QxvgzQFmOJE)

[Solving a problem](https://youtu.be/8r2DrCwKPRY)

Please note that the arrangement of the files has changed a bit since we recorded this video. Follow the guide below when ensuring you are in the right directory to run `npm install` and `npm test`.

[Pushing and committing your code](https://youtu.be/WkZvpDnphqE)

1. Fork and clone this repository as seen in the video below.

2. `cd` into the repository.

3. Run `npm install` in your terminal.

4. Run `npm test` in your terminal to see the test suite. You will see lots of red - that's good!

5. Open the index.js challenge file in VS Code and begin solving them.

6. Run the test suite regularly using `npm test` to see how you are doing.

7. If you stall on one problem and want to move on, you'll find that the tests will end at the last incorrect challenge. To allow the test suite to move on, open the index file in the spec folder. Find the describe block for the function you are currently writing, and place an x before it, like this:

```js
xdescribe('getLastWord', () => {
  it('returns the last word of the passed sentence', () => {
    expect(getLastWord('hello')).to.equal('hello');
    //etc
  });
});
```

This will allow the test suite to skip over it and it will list as 'pending' in your terminal on running `npm test`.

8. Practice using git from the command line by adding and committing your work frequently as you work through the exercises. When you solve a problem, make a commit.

9. If you're having difficulties, you can post on the NC Slack Channel - we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible, and there's usually some helpful current / former / upcoming students with useful advice too :)
